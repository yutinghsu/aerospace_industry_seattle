# Design and Implement
<P>From data attritubes of Locus_seattle_aerospace_Sept17.xlsx, the dataset is the relationship of different kinds of companies of aerospace industry in Seattle.
Each node represent a kind of company in aerospace. The edges between nodes have a driection associated with nodes. So I used a directed graph to visualize the dataset.
Also, from information of Locus Map of Businesses in United States (https://www.maps.locus/), each kind of company is under a activity, I add different colors to help users understand the data.
